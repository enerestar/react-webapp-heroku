# reactwebapp

To run the project, go to https://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx to create your api key.

Once you have that, create a folder `keys` in src and a json file `api.json` with your omdb api key. 
reactwebapp
|- package.json
|- /src
  |- keys
    |- api.json

Run `npm i`
Run `npm run start` for development
